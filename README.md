# w0rp.com site

This repository is for building [w0rp.com](https://w0rp.com/).

w0rp.com is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate the entire site as
static content. Install Hugo and run `./generate.sh` to build the site content,
and you can make the contents of the `public` directory available via a
webserver.
