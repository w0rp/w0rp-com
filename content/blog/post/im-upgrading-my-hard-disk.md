In case anyone missed the message and wants to know why I'm not on IRC, I'm
currently upgrading my server's hard disk to a higher capacity. Once that's up
and running, I should be able to archive more important Internet content than
ever before. I'd like to recommend [Clonezilla](https://clonezilla.org/) for
being a very good utility for transferring data from disk to image to disk.

I should be online again within the next two days or so.
