Merry Christmas to all from the Dense Analysis team! Today ALE [has been
released as v3.3.0](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale/releases/tag/v3.3.0).
These GitHub releases don't mean much in the way of new code, given that most
users just follow `master` anyway, but some users like to tag specific release
versions for distribution. In any case, enjoy!

ALE has been a project running for over 6 years now, and hopefully the fun will
never stop. As ever [hsanson](https://github.com/hsanson) does a fine job
maintaining ALE. I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to ALE so
far, especially for everything in this release. There's some useful additions,
and it's bound to benefit everyone in one way or another. There will be more to
come for ALE in future.

I will add that I and a few friends are working on important things other than
ALE I won't speak about publicly yet. I'll just say that it's all for charity
and supporting FOSS. Hopefully I should be able to make an important
announcement some time mid 2023 about it.
