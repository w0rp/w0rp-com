## What Is This All About?

[Jason Scott](http://ascii.textfiles.com/), computer historian and archivist,
has said on several occasions that it is important to try and preserve your own
[digital history](https://ia600807.us.archive.org/15/items/personaldigitalarchiving2012pt2/pda2012-27jasonscott.mp4).
As far as the history of popular or important figures goes, someone else will
probably make an effort. When it comes to things that probably only hold some
significance to you, you might be on your own.

I am going to make a small attempt to make mention of something I did, which was
of interest at least to myself. I might seem perhaps obsessive about this
particular thing that I did, but that will be fine. Because even if what I did
was only of any real significance to myself, by the end of this blog post I will
be able to say that I will have at least made some effort to explain what it was
that I did. What I did was something very minor, but potentially entertaining.

A few years ago, I managed, with a modicum of skill and a burst of creativity,
to embark on a musical project. This was a very short lived project which was
directly the consequence of my involvement with a very minor imageboard and BBS
community, paired with an IRC channel. For a time, we, as was our culture, kept
much of our culture, what little culture there was, as some kind of closely
guarded secret. This secrecy was also again part of our culture; some manner of
*ironic joke*. Feel free to make the jump from "ironic joke" to "hipster." We
would probably find that funny.

## What Was SAOVQ?

First, a little bit of history. What *we* were as a community was a collection
of anonymous and pseudonymous Internet users who had a variety of shared
interests, none of which were probably that compelling. They included the
following.

1. Anime and by extension Japan in general.
2. A love for the modern day BBS.
3. A love for imageboards.
4. A desire for ridiculous, but still clever humour.
5. A love of the idea of secrecy and niche community.

So, as you might guess, we all had some attraction to communities like
[2channel](http://2ch.net/), [2chan](http://2chan.net), and of course
[4chan](https://www.4chan.org), among other communities. Amidst all of
these communities, we all had a shared affection for [4-ch.net](http://4-ch.net/),
particularly for the [DQN](http://4-ch.net/dqn/) BBS, which amazingly has
survived to this day. Who *we* were was a Western collection of self proclaimed
**VIPPERS**, inspired by the 2-ch BBS [news4vip](http://hayabusa5.2ch.net/news4vip/).
Our fun community was the rather humourously named the [Secret Area of VIP Quality](http://secretareaofvipquality.net/).

I could go on about this in much greater detail, but I shall leave the
completely unimportant history of this extremely minor community to one side. A
fellow VIPPER has already made the effort to host
[a rather amusing wiki](http://tanasinn.info/wiki/Main_Page) for some
time which explains much of this already, which I have personally assured is
backed up hopefully for all time on the Internet Archive.

## Where Did the Music Come From?

Japanese and Japanese-inspired BBS communities used to do, and as am I still
aware, still do a rather novel thing. Out of bursts of creativity, a desire for
a little bit of fun, and perhaps some boredom, every now and then people in the
BBS or imageboard would take it upon themselves to do creative works of art.
Text art, Flash movies, small or even large video games, and of course music.
What was novel about all of this is that a lot of the music was credited only
anonymously or to some kind of Internet pseudonym, and none of it was ever taken
seriously, which I believe made it more enjoyable. So the focus wasn't on the
person who was making the creative work, but more the creative work itself.

After a time, the DQN BBS started to follow in this trend, and the first thing
to come of it to my mind was the concept of **song threads**. A song thread was
a rather fun way to transform mostly noise into something entertaining.

1. Start up your [song thread](http://4-ch.net/dqn/kareha.pl/1134104543).
2. List particular post numbers as being contributors to parts of the song.
3. Allow people to post over a period of time, until all the parts are ready.
4. The parts make up one complete song.
5. An amateur music producer can then step in and make an actual song out of it.
6. You then end up with something [like this](http://www.last.fm/music/Captain+Obvious/_/All+Alone+for+Christmas+%28pmix%29).

I still find this fascinating and endlessly entertaining, due in part to my
strange sense of humour.  After a time, this led to the creation of
[a very long thread](http://archives.4-ch.net/dqn/kareha.pl/1149386526).
This then resulted in, of course, [A Really Long Song](http://tanasinn.info/wiki/Title).
Some of the tracks, despite being formed entirely from random comments, took on
some kind of hilarious structure with hilarious results, like in
[track #2](http://rigelseven.com/dl/mirror/dqn/Title/02%20Second%20verse.mp3).

And so [the track went](http://tanasinn.info/wiki/Second_verse_%28Title%29)...

{{< rawhtml >}}
<blockquote><pre>
...
under the moon, loli to issho
Young man, do mannaka wari komi, Ryoute hiroge FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!
Show me! Show you! KIKKOMAN, KIKKOMAN
...
</pre></blockquote>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

The final line quoted there actually comes from
[another creative BBS effort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz-mJed_bP0).
I mention this track in particular because of its significance for myself. I
found this track to be hilarious, and amidst the album that one stood out for
me. I actually *kind of remembered the lyrics*, which still amazes me, given
that the lyrics are really just random noise from a thread somewhere. So one day
when it came to the point where I needed to choose a pseudonym for myself. I
thought of things that were relevant, and I thought, "I'll just go with **Soy
Sauce Warrior Kikkoman**." Of course, that being too long I thought, "I'll
shorten it down with an acronym. So I'll go with **SSW_Kikkoman**."

So I had my affection for music, and a dumb name for myself, and time would
pass.  Eventually, other DQN people would come to produce music that was
[A little less totally random](http://4-ch.net/dqn/kareha.pl/1187356489)
and a little more [really fucking awesome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i7n1qIICQM).
The [DQN Electronics](http://tanasinn.info/wiki/DQN_ELECTRONICS_VOL_2010)
albums were a hit with us
{{< rawhtml >}}<abbr title="Secret Area of VIP Quality">SAOVQ</abbr>{{< /rawhtml >}}
people, and we honestly got a little bit *jealous* of all of this great content
being the result of not strictly our community, but the DQN guys. So of course
after a time we decided to post
[our own effort](http://www.secretareaofvipquality.net/saovq/kareha.pl/1262411643/l50).
The results of all of them are currently hosted
[here](http://viptronic.org/albums/).
It is this series of albums where my efforts finally come in, as the track list went...

1. *VIPPER* &ndash; hello
2. *Italian VIPPER* &ndash; Birthday
3. *Reisen-Udongein-Inaba・平沢進* &ndash; Ｌｏｔｕｓ　ｆｔ．巡音ルカ
4. *VIPPER* &ndash; DADDYCOOL
5. **SSW_Kikkoman** &ndash; Satori

... and so on. So what happened was that I contributed a total of four album
tracks, and a few things that I wasn't quite happy enough about.

## So What Did You Make?

What I made was some very basic tracks with a number of constraints. Some of
these constraints resulted from my limited skill and resources. They were as
follows.

1. The tracks would all be produced entirely using my low to mid range desktop computer of the time.
2. I would produce the tracks from Linux, using entirely
   [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).
3. The tracks would not contain any lyrics, just music.
4. Every song would have a title which reflected some kind of spiritual idea,
   and the song would attempt to present the way this idea felt.

So given these constraints, here is what I ended up doing.

1. I produced the tracks using [LMMS](http://lmms.sourceforge.net/)
   and [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/).
2. I used my computer's regular keyboard and a computer mouse to play with
   sounds and arrange the music.
3. I made heavy use of reverb to give the tracks a sort of choir-like feel, like
   a church choir.

So, with limited resources, very little skill, and probably more time spent
producing the tracks than it would take for a professional to do it, I went and
did it. Let's get to the actual tracks now. We will look at the important
tracks, in the order of their production.

### Satori

This was my first contribution, and I produced it based on the idea of Satori.
There was a joke in there from a programming board about programming in the
language LISP leading to some form of enlightenment. The track has a flow
through it that is designed to make you feel a certain way. A few simple notes,
and over time more and more of a chorus builds up into what is supposed to be
one large collection of sound. All designed to symbolise a combination of ideas
building towards enlightenment, then serenity.

### Battleborn

This was my second contribution, not nearly as good as the first, I believed. I
produced an earlier version named
[Battleworn](https://soundcloud.com/leonardo-lemuel/battleworn/s-9ztsJ),
which was very Metroid theme inspired and was much slower. For the album I sped
it all up, threw in a kick drum, and gave it a more uplifting name. The track is
designed to give a feel of some kind of glorious ongoing conflict which breeds
some manner of spiritual significance. That's why I made it so punchy.

This track was again originally much slower, with less of a kick. It was named
[Myriad](https://soundcloud.com/leonardo-lemuel/myriad/s-lpqBL).
I again punched it up and gave it a *pulse* for the album. The track is supposed
to use reverb to give a feeling about some kind of infinite space, inhabited by
the many gods, real or imaginary. I wasn't sure what to name the result, and
then I discovered that if I took an anagram of the old name and threw in an
extra *p*, I would also get the word "pyramid." This made me think of ancient
Egypt and their many gods. So that is what I went with.

This was my final VIP musical contribution, and effectively the end of my
shortly lived amateur musical project. I tried to make the track more explosive
in some sense than my previous tracks, and I hope that a sense of my getting a
little better at what I was doing comes across. The track is designed to give
you this feeling of the mental states you must go through in maintaining a
spiritual state of *watchfulness.* The track has small beginnings, running
bursts of melody, and ends on an extended outro to attempt to give this feel.

I absolutely must note that someone made a
[fucking incredible](https://soundcloud.com/marisa-cosplayer/ssw_kikkoman-nepsis-remix)
remix of my final track after I vanished, without my knowledge, and put it on
the very next album, attributed to me. You must hear this track right now if you
have not heard it. I was absolutely blown away by it. Seriously. I am **very
happy** that I at least managed to inspire this creative work, if for nothing
else.

## Sum It Up

1. I am an Internet geek.
2. I had some geek e-friends.
3. We liked music and junk.
4. I made some fun stuff.

That's about the grand total of it all. It was a fun project for a while. I
might pursue similar interests in the future some time. I hope whoever took the
time to read all of this enjoyed the post and maybe even got some fun music to
listen to out of it. Maybe it also made you *think*.

Did you like any of my music? Well you might like the
[VIP albums](http://viptronic.org/albums/) or the DQN albums. Search on a
PirateBay mirror for a torrent with all the DQN albums. I still seed that
torrent myself from time to time.

Have any thoughts, comments? Why not leave them in *my comment section?* Did I
