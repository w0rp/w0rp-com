**Update December 21st 2023:** I converted this entire site to Hugo templates
and remove the comment form so there's one less thing to maintain.

I have added the ability to comment on articles on this blog site, rendering in
what I hope will be a pleasing manner. IP addresses for comments will be logged
for the purpose of banning spammers and so on. Comments are encouraged to be
anonymous, but a pseudonym can be used.

So, feel free to share your thoughts on my articles in the comment section. You
can share related things, point out mistakes, call me a jerk, post links to
images of cats. As long as you aren't blatantly linking to malware sites,
spamming, or just doing something otherwise nefarious, I promise that your
comment will stay there.
